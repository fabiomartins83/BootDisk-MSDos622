The purpose of this utility diskette is to assist the user in the event 
that the software provided on the CD-ROM needs to be reinstalled.

A batch file has been created in the event that DOS needs to be 
reinstalled onto the hard disk.  You should note that this batch 
file will ERASE the entire hard drive.  The batch file is called
"SETDOS.BAT" and it will format the hard disk identified as drive
C, transfer the system files, and then copy the entire DOS subdirectory
from the CD-ROM drive to the DOS subdirectory on the hard disk. 

Once DOS has been copied to your hard disk, the AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS
files from drive A will be copied onto your hard disk along with the
system files to support your CD-ROM.  At this point you should have full   
access to your hard disk and CD-ROM and you will no longer need to boot
from the Setup Diskette.

If you wish to reinstall DOS without formatting the hard disk the XCOPY
command can be used.  An example of this command might be:

                        XCOPY D:\DOS C:\DOS

This command will perform the same function as SETDOS but it will not  
format the hard disk. If you need to transfer the system files to your 
hard drive the following command can be used:

                        SYS A: C:

A brief description of each directory located on the CD is listed below:

DOS6_2          This subdirectory contains the files for DOS ver 6.2.                  
                The XCOPY command is used to install these files to the
                system hard drive. 
                
WFW3_11         This subdirectory contains the files for Windows for 
                Workgroups ver 3.11. To install Windows go into the 
                Windows subdirectory and type in SETUP from the DOS prompt.  
                It is recommended that the "Custom" setup procedure be 
                used when installing Windows. When Windows searches for 
                applications do not search the CD-ROM drive (drive D).  
                
MOUSE           This subdirectory contains the Mouse driver files.  To                
                install the Mouse driver files go into the Mouse
                subdirectory and type in SETUP from the DOS prompt.
